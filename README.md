# Build RedAster outside STM32CubeIDE

Follow the next steps to build the project with CMake on any platform.

### Requirements:

* __CMake Version__:
   The project requires the 3.28 minimum version for CMake, so make sure to have the right version installed. To check the version:
   ```
   cmake --version
   ```
* __Arm GNU Toolchain__:
  To build an embedded project base on Amr Cortex is required to have the right compiler toolchain.
  Download it from [Arm's official website](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) for your OS.
  Or get it with a package manager.
  
  macOS:
  ```
  brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
  ```
  Linux:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install arm-none-eabi-gcc
  ```
  Windows
  ```
  choco install gcc-arm-embedded
  ```
### Build the project:
At this point you have the needed tools. Run the following bash commands to create a folder called __build__ to store all the files generated by CMake, including the .bin and .elf files. 
The -S flag is needed to provide the directory that contains the source files (" . " means the directory you are located rigth now), and -B flag speifies the build directory (if it does not exist CMake will create it for you). 
Then you run the command that acctually builds the program.

```
cmake -S . -B build # use the current directory as source dir and create build 
cmake --build build # compiles the project in the build folder
```
